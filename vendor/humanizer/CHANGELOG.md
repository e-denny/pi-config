# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.12.4] - 2026-09-27

Humanizer source and Vale refresh, patch release.

- **humanizer 1.7.2:** absorb rendered-surface line-break guidance and extend the fabricated-speaker guardrail to drafting in another person's voice. Add staged-discovery variants and narrow literal-use carve-outs to the performed-insight catalog.
- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.6 -> 1.1.7:** update `patterns.js` to avoid-ai-writing tip `2a7e999`. Quoted spans and single-line quote blocks are masked; staged-discovery variants are covered. `validate.js` is unchanged.
- **writing-prose 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1:** update Vale to `v3.23.0`, sync Microsoft styles, and verify Windows and WSL binaries. House config unchanged.
- Package version: `2.12.3` -> `2.12.4`.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-09-25

Live-install delta merge: editorial work that had reached the installed skills
but never landed here is now in the monorepo, and the humanizer
editing-contract work from 2.12.2 is back on the installed copies. Ingest-only
release, patch.

- **humanizer 1.7.1 -> 1.7.2:** five editing-procedure rules (prefer no-op to an
  uncertain edit; do not pad back to length after cutting puffery; treat your own
  in-thread draft as foreign text; after a preservation FAIL repair only the
  blocking spans; match quote and apostrophe family on edited spans), nine
  guardrail bullets (dated slang, historical voice, low-variance and
  neurodivergent cadence, force-bearing quantifier preservation, deletion and
  reversion tests, promotional drift, overloaded-domain "proof", staging-tell
  thresholds, same-genre voice samples), the fiction carve-out for invented
  detail, and a Voice-match hypothesis step in the invented-specifics test.
- **humanizer references:** `pattern-catalog.md` gains **Absorbed tells 100-106**
  (vague association, empty concession sandwich, significance-adverb density,
  parallel reason chains, intensifier/diminisher opposition, participial
  reframe, hedged-enumeration openers) plus the attributive-only hyphen rule on
  pattern 78; `required-checks.md` gains the ordinal and simultaneity verify,
  the sentence-adds-a-fact test, and quote-family matching; `humanizing-text.md`
  routes fiction detail to the new prose reference and drops a contrast tail.
- **simple-english 2.4.0 -> 2.4.1:** a heading must carry three sentences of
  body; define a concept in at most ten words at first use; vertical lists only
  for three or more parallel items; spell out a technical noun over three words
  once; strict extras for `follow`, `above`/`below`, `help`, unsure possessives,
  `but`/`because`, `do`/`prevent`/`do again`, named targets, and phrasal verbs.
- **writing-prose 1.1.4 -> 1.2.0:** new `references/narrative-architecture.md`
  (plot, theme, time, and cast tells; architecture before surface style) and
  `references/scientific-register.md` (scholarly voice, venue sampling,
  tech-article openings). SKILL.md routes fiction and paper prose to them and
  samples recent artifacts from the target venue.
- SOURCES drift fixed: `ai_writing_detector_skill_version` and the packaged
  table now match the shipped **1.1.6**; README skill table refreshed from
  1.6.0/2.4.0/1.1.1/1.1.2 to 1.7.2/2.4.1/1.1.6/1.2.0.
- `tests/test_voice_contracts.py`: the version-alignment check read hardcoded
  1.2.0/2.4.0/1.1.0/package 2.4.0 values and had been failing since long before
  this release. It now derives each skill version from the skill's own
  frontmatter and asserts README, SOURCES, and CHANGELOG agree, so the guard
  cannot go stale again.
- Merge method: files where the installed copy was a strict superset were taken
  whole; `humanizer/SKILL.md` was hand-merged because both sides carried unique
  rules. The installed Vale `accept.txt` keeps its local addition and stays out
  of the public package.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-09-25

Humanizer editing-contract clarification absorbed from avoid-ai-writing v3.36.0.

- Separate candidate matches, justified findings, and authorized edits. Routine
  cleanup preserves structure and argument; broad restructuring needs clear
  scope. Ground factual changes in source material and preserve attribution,
  quantities, conditions, causality, and uncertainty. Protect quotes, tables,
  code, identifiers, and frontmatter. Leave clean input unchanged and report
  protected or source-blocked findings instead of forcing edits.
- Define a shared two-pass ceiling for corrective edits and preservation repair,
  with explicit pass accounting and stop reasons.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-09-23

avoid-ai-writing tip absorb (`3514947`, untagged, post-`7a2c7d1`).

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.5 -> 1.1.6:** engine absorb to upstream tip
  `3514947`. Preservation validator no longer opens a fence on a backtick line
  whose info string contains a backtick (upstream #330): a prose line like
  `` ```npm test``` `` previously opened an unterminated fence, so every later
  prose edit reported `code-block-modified`. Vendored `fence-probe.js` gains a
  permanent probe for the fix; smoke is 16/16. `patterns.js` comment-only
  refresh (stylometric TODO accounting, corpus calibration notes, #335).
  Humanizer editorial unaffected; upstream CLI `--context` fix (#327) is not
  vendored machinery here. Pin fields in SOURCES.md refreshed, monorepo patch.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-09-19

avoid-ai-writing tip absorb (`7a2c7d1`, untagged, post-v3.35.0) plus vale 3.22.0
release ingest.

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.4 -> 1.1.5:** engine refreshed to upstream tip
  `7a2c7d1`. `acknowledgment-loop` retired as a detector type (#239): the three
  phrases also open ordinary replies and standard analytical English, so the
  engine exposes **53** types now. The skill keeps the rule as a judgment call.
  CJK/Japanese unsegmented-script documents are declined as `Unsupported
  script` before the word gate (#241). CommonMark-correct fence and inline-code
  scanning (#236, #314), Title Case header matches are line-bound and accept
  first-person `I` (#291, #240), URL tracker-strip false positive fixed
  (#210), bullet-list parsing made CommonMark-exact, version-heading em-dash
  counting rewritten as a line scanner. `validate.js` gains the CommonMark
  fence scanner (#236) and punctuation-preserving URL normalization (#210);
  package banner kept. Behavioral probes added for the ack-loop retirement,
  CJK decline, Title Case line-bound, fence boundary, and URL-strip fixes.
- **humanizer:** `ai-ism-audit.md` marks acknowledgment loops as a judgment
  call with the upstream rationale (detector retired, rule stays).
- **writing-prose 1.1.3 -> 1.1.4:** vale binary refreshed to `v3.22.0` in WSL
  `~/.local/bin` (Hunspell-conformant spelling, per-section `Vocab`, empty
  `BasedOnStyles`/`UNSET` clearing, MDX/notebook format gains), Microsoft
  style pack re-synced, house gate verified clean on `README.md`. No house
  config changes; the 3.22.0 features are opt-in and not adopted yet.
- Pins moved: avoid-ai-writing `fc979c6` -> `7a2c7d1` (tip, untagged); vale
  `v3.21.0` -> `v3.22.0`.
- SOURCES drift fixed: `simple_english_skill_version` summary/table now match
  the shipped 2.4.0; `writing_prose_skill_version` now matches 1.1.4;
  `ai_writing_detector_skill_version` corrected to 1.1.5.
- Note: `vale-lint.sh` in the monorepo has CRLF line endings, so it fails when
  invoked from inside WSL. Windows git-bash invocation is unaffected. Fix
  queued for the next packaging pass; the gate was verified by calling vale
  directly.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-09-16

avoid-ai-writing v3.35.0 engine absorb.

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.3 → 1.1.4:** `patterns.js` refreshed to upstream
  v3.35.0 (`fc979c6`). `--context technical` now suppresses eight
  technical-legitimate terms (`robust`, `comprehensive`, `seamless`,
  `ecosystem`, `leverage`, `facilitate`, `underpin`, `streamline`); Title Case
  header rule accepts acronym interior tokens; quadratic scans in
  `analyzeText()` are now linear; `emotional-flatline` relabeled "Stock
  reaction framing", style-only for authorship scoring. `validate.js`
  unchanged. Not vendored: upstream GitHub Action / pre-commit gate and
  fp-measure tooling. `categories.md` aligned with the new behavior.
- **humanizer:** audit ref gains the "Stock reaction framing" rename note and
  the technical-context carve-out language.
- Pins moved: `v3.34.0` → `v3.35.0`, ref `b3e4bbd` → `fc979c6`.
- vale re-checked: latest release is still `v3.21.0` (scan false positive);
  no ingest.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-09-12

Generic writing-voice sample harvest.

- **writing-voice 1.0.0 → 1.1.0:** on-demand compiled profile from the
  user's own samples (`references/voice-from-samples.md`), fingerprint
  collision rule, a few portable hard bans. No identity facts. Personalized
  Hermes copy stays private.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-09-12

Chase mode and hosted detector spread.

- **humanizer 1.6.2 → 1.7.0:** Chase depth iterates on `ai-writing-detector`
  scores. Fingerprint gate (keep / ask / never inject) for social drafts.
  Cargo-cult evasion (typos, fake personality) still rejected.
- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.3 → 1.2.0:** `scripts/test_detectors.py` with
  `--demo` (offline) and `--upload` (hosted APIs, full-draft disclosure).
  Authorship claims still refused.

## [2.9.5] - 2026-09-12

avoid-ai-writing `v3.34.0` (`b3e4bbd`). No engine delta versus tip `a465548`.

- **Pin only.** `detector/patterns.js` and `detector/validate.js` are unchanged
  from the #73 em-dash zero-weight absorb. Detector skill stays 1.1.3.
  Humanizer skill stays 1.6.2 (pattern 7 note already matches).
- **Held:** upstream CLI (`bin/avoid-ai-writing.js`, #158), pattern-proposal
  issue form, SSOT CI, README npm/follow docs. We already ship analyze and
  validate CLIs; house style does not need their packaging layer.

## [2.9.4] - 2026-09-11

vale-cli/vale `v3.20.0` → `v3.21.0` (pin refresh).

- **writing-prose 1.1.2 → 1.1.3**: the house gate now runs on vale 3.21.0.
  Style packs re-synced; house config unchanged and still single-voice
  (HermesHouse over Microsoft). No new config keys needed: the release adds
  `doc(...)` selections, TextFSM views, and Jupyter support, none of which
  the house style uses yet.

avoid-ai-writing tip `a465548` past `v3.33.0` (no new tag).

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.2 → 1.1.3**: the `em-dash` rule weight drops 4
  to 0, so over-limit dashes stay visible as P2 writing-quality flags
  without moving the score, label, probabilities, or classification
  (upstream #73). Vendored `patterns.js` is byte-identical to upstream tip.
  House smoke is green plus a behavioral probe (dash-heavy text flags but
  scores the same as its baseline).
- **humanizer 1.6.1 → 1.6.2**: pattern 7 notes dash frequency is a style
  judgment, never an authorship signal, matching upstream's new zero
  weight. The house rule was already there; upstream caught up.
- **Held**: the bare-URL quote-boundary fix in upstream
  `scripts/markdown-prose.js` (packaging tooling we do not vendor) and the
  README follow invitation (packaging noise).

## [2.9.2] - 2026-09-06

avoid-ai-writing moves to `v3.33.0` (`6da13ad`) and blader/humanizer to
`v3.0.0` (`9862685`).

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.1 → 1.1.2**: engine vendored at `v3.33.0` with
  two precise fixes. The `load-bearing` rule flips from a structural-noun
  blocklist to an abstract-noun allowlist (fires only before assumption,
  claim, invariant, premise, constraint, dependency, argument, or
  abstraction; literal, predicative, and unlisted uses pass), trading recall
  for precision. The preservation validator normalizes CRLF line endings up
  front so frontmatter and tables in Windows-authored documents stay visible
  to protection checks. House smoke is green plus behavioral probes for both
  fixes.
- **humanizer 1.6.0 → 1.6.1**: catalog grows to patterns 96-99 as
  judgment-only P2 entries (transformation crutch, consequence-free
  restatement, repeated empty concessions, repeated setup/reversal
  punchlines), each with carve-outs and a never-invent repair rule. Pattern
  9 gains split-sentence, multi-negation, and tailing-negation forms.
  Pattern 72 adopts the abstract-noun boundary; pattern 74 gains the
  obscured-decision-maker P2. Required checks gain a five-tell post-rewrite
  sweep (contrast, closer, dash, triad, bold label).
- **Not absorbed**: OpenAI plugin packaging, quote-normalizer and
  style-checker scripts, SKILL-to-references split, and prose-contract
  rewordings (packaging and tooling, not editorial knowledge); blader v3.0
  strength ordering kept as upstream organization, with its durable
  workflow and carve-outs folded into the entries above.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-09-05

avoid-ai-writing moves to `v3.29.0` (`d8c2351`) and vale to `3.20.0`.

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.0 → 1.1.1**: engine vendored at `v3.29.0` with
  three new detector types (51 → 54): `launch-intro` (product-launch
  introductions), `crowd-contrast` (claims propped on an invented lagging
  crowd), and `fake-casual-prop` (stage directions and wink asides). Every
  rule carries disclosed false-positive residue and deliberate misses;
  upstream test fixtures pass and house smoke is green.
- **humanizer catalog patterns 93-95**: the same three tells as editorial
  entries with repair guidance and carve-outs. A duplicate pattern-86 section
  was also merged back into one entry.
- **writing-prose**: vale binary updated to `3.20.0` (WSL; style packs
  resynced, house gate green). The release is style-authoring focused (rule
  inheritance, nested rule directories); the house config is unchanged.
- **Not absorbed**: corpus seed entries (upstream measurement infrastructure)
  and the readme pattern-count wording.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-29

avoid-ai-writing pin moves to `v3.28.0` (3bd64f1): three commits past
v3.26.0 (v3.27.0 rendered-markdown source mode + v3.28.0 Willison
rhetorical-tic categories). Upstream main carries one unreleased docs
commit; not ingested.

- **Engine vendored at v3.28.0** (ai-writing-detector 1.0.6 → 1.1.0):
  patterns.js gains `performed-insight`, `negation-chain`,
  `dev-blog-boilerplate` detector types (48 → 51 types) and
  `analyzeText({sourceMode: "rendered-markdown"})` frontmatter/comment
  masking. Upstream test fixtures all pass; house smoke suite 16/16.
- **humanizer 1.5.0 → 1.6.0**: pattern catalog gains **pattern 86
  Performed-insight phrases** (the one judgment rule our catalog lacked;
  the other six Willison categories were already absorbed). Fix guidance
  and the quoted-speech carve-out carried over in house voice.
- **Not absorbed**: the unreleased related-work README block (marketing).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-24

The AI-writing signals skill tracks upstream engine release v3.28.0, and the humanizer catalog grows by seven rhetorical-tic patterns.

### Added

- **ai-writing-detector 1.1.0**: engine pin to `v3.28.0` with three new
  detector types (`performed-insight`, `negation-chain`,
  `dev-blog-boilerplate`) and `sourceMode: "rendered-markdown"` scoring that
  masks YAML frontmatter and HTML comments while keeping issue offsets
  aligned with the source file.
- **humanizer patterns 86-92** in the catalog: performed insight, negation
  chain, dev-blog boilerplate, stacked rhetorical questions, same-opener
  sentence runs, stranded auxiliary contrast, and colon into a triple. The
  deterministic detector covers only the narrow subset of these; the rest
  stay editorial judgment.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-08-27

vale-cli/vale pin moves to `v3.19.0` (from v3.18.0). Patch bump, pin-only.

- **writing-prose**: WSL binary updated to 3.19.0; `vale sync` re-run for
  the Microsoft style pack. No house config change: the release is MDX/JSX
  children linting, Elixir comment extraction, and repeated-occurrence
  tokens, none of which touch Markdown prose rules we run. House gate
  verified on the skill set (SKILL.md clean, 0 errors).
- **Win11 winget** still at 3.17.1 (manifest lag); house config stays
  compatible with it.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-08-26

Humanizer now flags empty metaphor nouns and a couple of sentence habits that make a paragraph sound interchangeable with another project's docs.

### Added

- Abstract metaphor nouns in the vocabulary tiers (substrate, wedge, vector, locus, vantage, nexus, primitive-as-noun, flywheel, north star, endgame, and similar) with concrete-word substitutes.
- Interchangeability test on the required-checks revision gate: a sentence that could appear unchanged in another project's docs is carrying nothing specific to this piece.
- Mid-sentence colon crutch in the pattern catalog (connective colon with comparison framing). List and example colons stay legitimate.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-24

Edit mode refuses the wrong kind of file. Before rewriting a path in place, Humanizer confirms the file is prose and stops on source code, configuration, and generated data, with a reason. Quoted material, code blocks, and tables were already protected inside a file; this closes the choose-the-wrong-file case.

### Changed

- **humanizer 1.5.0**: prose-file gate in edit mode, documented in `ai-ism-audit.md`.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-22

New skill: `writing-voice` 1.0.0. One home for how an agent talks to its user, writes for other humans, and writes for machines.

### Added

- Three audience modes (Chat, Human, Worker) plus tone overlays (`<tone> <mode>`, for example "casual worker" or "professional human").
- Tone definitions live in the Humanizer voice-profile table. Writing Voice routes and never restates them. Never-inject bounds every tone.
- No personal data in the skill: no user facts, no platform names, no host paths beyond a deployment note. Personalized deployments keep their own copy and add user-specific routing on top.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-22

The Humanizer voice-profile table is now the tone definition store for Writing Voice subtypes. Writing Voice routes `<tone> <mode>` requests to that table and never restates the targets.

### Changed

- **humanizer 1.4.0**: voice-profile section notes the table doubles as the tone store. No target changes. The Never-inject binding from 2.5.3 still governs those tones.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-08-22

A voice profile can bring out what the source already has. It cannot manufacture what the source lacks.

### Changed

- **humanizer 1.3.1**: the voice-profile table opens with that binding. Casual, professional, and warm rows carry bounded targets, so the editor is not asked to add a first-person touch, a concrete claim, an explicit ask, or an acknowledgment the source never contained.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-08-21

The Vale gate runs 3.18.0. More document formats, same house rules.

### Changed

- **writing-prose 1.1.1**: WSL Vale binary updated to 3.18.0 (native MDX, Typst, Quarto, MyST, QDoc, R Markdown, plus scoping and alert-position fixes). House gate verified on the sample set and a real draft. Win11 winget still lags at 3.17.1; the WSL binary stays canonical.
- `READMEs` added to the house accept list (pre-existing Vale spelling false positive).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-08-19

Closing Markdown fences now follow CommonMark: a fence is closed only when the closer is followed by spaces or tabs. An info string such as ` ```js ` no longer closes an outer fence, so headings inside a fenced block stay masked from the title-case-header rule.

### Changed

- **ai-writing-detector 1.0.6**: engine fence-range fix. New `scripts/fence-probe.js` behavioral probe (info-string masking, blank-suffix close, nbsp stays fenced, CRLF close) wired into `smoke.sh`.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-19

Humanizer's pattern catalog grows by five durable tells.

### Added

- Patterns 81–85: rhetorical setup (*What if...?*, *Think about it:*, *And that's okay*), narrator-from-a-distance, announced significance (*this is what X actually looks like*), additive hedge escalation (*not just X but also Y*), and template narrative arc (*By the time X, I was Y*). Each has tell, repair, and carve-outs, cross-referenced against adjacent patterns 9 and 76.

### Changed

- **humanizer 1.3.0**: version bump for the five catalog patterns.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-18

`ste_lint` is now `voice_lint`. The linter is a generic voice check, not STE-locked, and it can report AI-slop tells without counting them as form violations.

### Changed

- **Rename**: `scripts/ste_lint.py` → `scripts/voice_lint.py`. Usage docs, the test contract, and sibling references updated. Historical changelog entries keep the old name.
- **New `tells` report-only dict** (never counted toward `total`): cliché global openers, conclusion signposts, hedge softeners, AI buzzwords, and the "No A. No B. Just C." negation triad. Narrow legitimate uses stay judgment calls.
- **simple-english 2.4.0**: version bump for the rename and tells.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-18

voice_lint catches a single clipped negation fragment (`"Not a X."`) closing a paragraph.

### Added

- **simple-english 2.3.0**: `detect_rhythm()` gains `end_para_neg_fragments` for verbless negation fragments that close a paragraph. Precise shape keeps false positives near zero: paragraph-final segment only, negation lead plus determiner or adjective, no finite verb, no contrast-comma continuation. Skipped idioms include "Not that", "No,", "No thanks", "No one", and "Not everyone". Report-only, never counted toward the form total.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-18

Prose-rhythm findings join the mechanical lint.

### Added

- **simple-english 2.2.0**: voice_lint gains `detect_rhythm()`, reporting staccato stacks (3+ consecutive sentences of six words or fewer) and clipped negation-fragment tails ("No X. No Y." closing a paragraph). Sentence-length variance ships as context. Markdown-aware: headings break stacks, each bullet is one unit, table rows are skipped. Rhythm findings are reported separately and never counted toward the form total.

### Fixed

- **simple-english 2.2.1**: flush staccato stacks that run to end of text.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-17

Skills now declare who they write for. Humanizer is for other humans. Simple English is for machines and procedures.

### Added

- **simple-english 2.1.0**: Worker register (machines and procedures only; README and changelog work bounce to Humanizer).
- **humanizer 1.2.0**: Human register (READMEs, changelogs, public posts, OSS issues and PR comments; PR bodies bounce to Simple English).

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-17

Humanizer picks up two new editorial patterns and tightens a few existing ones.

### Added

- **humanizer 1.1.1**: patterns 79 (shadowboxing objections) and 80 (editorial scar tissue). Pattern 11 extended with repeated sentence openings. Pattern 21 extended with casual-register signposts ("heads up", "quick note", "one thing that bit me"). Figurative "gate/gated/gating" added to Tier 2 vocabulary, with a technical-usage carve-out (CI gates, gated clocks, gated releases stay). Named objections, real design alternatives, and deliberate rhetorical repetition stay.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-17

`plain-english` is now `simple-english`. The skill carries a full practical STE catalog.

### Changed

- **simple-english 2.0.0** (renamed from plain-english): word, verb, sentence, punctuation, and structure rules with ASD-STE100 rule-number citations; modal ladder; slop-to-simple substitution table; vocabulary discipline; word-counting rules (backticked commands count as one word); condition-first; warnings-before-steps; and beyond-documentation use cases (error messages, runbooks, incident reports, release notes, agent instructions, translation prep). Adds `references/checklist.md` and `references/use-cases.md`. Existing strict and STE-flavored modes, the linter workflow, and guardrails stay.
- Cross-skill references, README, and tests use the new name. Install command is `npx skills add apoapostolov/humanizer --skill simple-english`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-14

Clearer voice ownership across the suite.

### Changed

- **humanizer 1.1.0**: explicit voice hierarchy. User samples, medium, audience, and source voice outrank generic pattern rules. Mixed documents are edited by section job instead of passing through every skill in sequence.
- **plain-english 1.1.0**: separates strict form control from STE-flavored diagnosis. Contractions and sentence-length findings are no longer automatic failures in natural technical prose. Mixed-document whole-file scoring is rejected.
- **writing-prose 1.1.0**: Vale warnings are reread prompts. Drops a stale dependency on the retired `writing` skill. Blocks forced facts, manufactured digressions, and uniform short-sentence cleanup.
- Mode-boundary examples and regression tests for the cross-skill voice contract.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-13

The detector and Humanizer both treat unnecessary hyphenation as a copyedit, not an authorship signal.

### Added

- **ai-writing-detector 1.0.5**: `unnecessary-hyphenation` rule (welded open noun phrases, closed-form compounds, adverbial attributive hyphens). Zero-weight P2 copyedit; it does not affect the AI score. Path masking hardened against superlinear backtracking.
- **humanizer**: pattern 57 expanded with cut-first `actually` guidance (delete when emphasis-only, keep for named corrections). New pattern 78 (unnecessary hyphenation). "Hyphenated modifier pile" renamed to "hyphenated modifier stacking."

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-07

Maintenance only. No skill behavior change.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-05

Detector lookup no longer false-positives on `constructor`. Vale gate moves to 3.17.1.

### Fixed

- **ai-writing-detector 1.0.4**: `Object.hasOwn` guard in tier lookups. `check-engine-pin.sh` syntax bug fixed.

### Changed

- **writing-prose 1.0.1**: Vale binary 3.17.0 → 3.17.1 (startup and lookaround performance, Org HTML writer, dry-run config, Windows on ARM). No style-pack or config changes.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

Initial release. Four writing skills for agents: Humanizer, Plain English, AI Writing Detector, and Writing Prose.

MIT licensed. See each skill's `SKILL.md` for usage.
